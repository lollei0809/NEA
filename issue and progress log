13/11/2024:
-   created main guard with implementation of CLI
-   discovered the question type did not get the correct conversion (ubtd instead of dtub)-->
    now trying to make the type_acr a parameter of the question class to initialise the type correctly
-   discovered a duplicate in a set of plausible answers-->
    checking over duplicate handling in create plausible answers
--> use set data structure to more cleanly ensure no duplicates.
14/11/2024:
-   added class attribute for allowed types
-   fixed checking the user answer. entering int or str
21/11/24:
-   removed getpass
-   made sign in handle incorrect usernames and passwords
-   ensuring incorrect plausible answers are correct type (int not str for base 10)
-   changed score to num correct and incorrect and recorded high score accordingly
--> randomly serve question and weight it towards questions the user got wrong
--> calc_average_correct method to use in automatic question type selection
--> recommend_question method
--> turn details dict into json
22/11/24
-   attempt to integrate json file. can work through console to change num correct incorrect
    and put that in correct location in json file
-   made sure main guard can navigate functions properly
-   worked from real python working with json data. the "interacting with json" could give
    suggestions for the evaluation section on areas to improve
25/11/24
-   calc average correct with exception handling
-   began recommend question method
28/11/24
-   work on reccomend question algithm
5/12/24
-   begin GUI
-   game class with main loop, input handling, game logic and drawing
-   need to have a way to choose a background color
-   problem with pygame that it will not have any packaged up buttons, just areas on the screen that can be clicked:
-   use a tkinter sign in / set up
-   continual loops in both tkinter and pygame so shut down tkinter before running pygame
10/12/24
--> use pygame rects instead of vector2 as velocities not needed, 1d movement.
--> easily change speeds at higher levels by increasing clock tick
