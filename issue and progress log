-   discovered the question type did not get the correct conversion (ubtd instead of dtub)-->
    now trying to make the type_acr a parameter of the question class to initialise the type correctly
-   discovered a duplicate in a set of plausible answers-->
    checking over duplicate handling in create plausible answers
--> use set data structure to more cleanly ensure no duplicates.
14/11/2024:

21/11/24:
